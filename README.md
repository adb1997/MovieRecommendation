# MovieRecommendation
Movie recommender

Taking inspiration from the famous Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, provided MATLAB code for a movie recommendation system.
It uses Collaborative Filtering for deducing the cost function to simultaneously learn the parameters X and Theta. 

X is a feature vector which takes into account factors like Romance/Action quotient of the movies. 
Theta is a vector of ratings given by users. 

The cost function is reduced using gradient descent which can be further sped up by using Adam Optimiser on Tensorflow. 

This project was part of the course and has been changed and improved for learning purposes only.
